### Purpose
To showcase myself, my past expereiences, and skills to potential employers who are looking to recruit for a tech related roll. The website will contact my contact details, socials, a short biography, projects, a blog, skills, and expereinces. 

### Functionality
The design I went for with my inital portfolio website was a very minimalistic approach that focused on responsiveness and being easy to read and navigate. The website is responsive and is very similar in desktop and tablet sized screens. Further changes are made to the desgin on phone screens to keep the interface responsive on all screen sizes.

The simplicity can be seen throughout the website with the theme being black text with a white background. A nav bar is included on all pages for ease of navigation and includes an underling hover effect.

The aim of the **Home** page, was to provide a quick intoduction of myself through my full name, a headshot photo, and my contact details. There are also two social icons which will link away to those social links when clicked. I've also made it easier for a visiter to identify that the logos are links by adding a rotate hover effect for each socail logo.

The **Bio** page includes three sections containing my backgroound, skills, and interests. Each section also has an image which was shot by me, or is of me. The goal of this page was to describe myself in further detail.

The **Experiences** section lists my past work expereince, and also current and past education in list style format. I've removed list decoration and centered the list for aesthetic purposes as it makes the text easier to read. There is also a button on the page which will direct the visitor to a PDF version of my current resume. The button also includes a hover effect when hovered over to signify that it is a link.

The **Blog** section more or less is set up the same way as the bio section. There are 5 blog containers, each containing a photo, heading, date published, and text.
